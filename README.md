# Getting Started

Below are two installation methods to set up and use CV Tools on your local machine. The Docker-based setup is recommended for a hassle-free experience. Alternatively, you can set up the tool manually from the source, which offers flexibility to either compile the PDF locally or generate the .tex file and use an external LaTeX renderer like [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com).

## Installation

### Method 1: Using Docker (Recommended)

Using docker allows you to run the tool in a consistent environment without worrying about dependencies on your local machine.

#### Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. You can download and install Docker from [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

#### Steps

Clone the Repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mlsdpk/cv-tools.git
$ cd cv-tools
```

Build the Docker image using the provided `Dockerfile`.

```bash
$ docker build -t cv-tools .
```

Start a Docker container with the image you just built. This will launch an interactive shell with the virtual environment activated and mount the current cv-tools directory.

```bash
$ docker run -it -v $(pwd):/workdir cv-tools
```

The `-v $(pwd):/workdir` option mounts your local cv-tools directory to the `/workdir` directory inside the container.

### Method 2: From Source with Manual Installation

If you prefer to set up the environment manually on your local machine, follow the steps below. This method offers two options:

1. Use an external LaTeX renderer (e.g., [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com)) to compile the .tex file.
2. Install a LaTeX engine locally and generate the PDF directly.

#### Prerequisites

- **Option 1: External LaTeX Renderer**

  No LaTeX distribution is needed. You can generate the .tex file and upload it to tools like [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com).

- **Option 2: Local LaTeX Setup**

  Ensure you have a LaTeX distribution installed, such as [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) (recommended) or [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/).

- **Python**: Python 3.x is required for running the build scripts.

#### Installing Dependencies

Clone the Repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mlsdpk/cv-tools.git
$ cd cv-tools
```

Set up a Python virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
$ python3 -m venv cv-tools
$ source cv-tools/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you plan to use Option 2 (Local LaTeX Setup), ensure all required LaTeX packages are installed. The necessary packages are listed in the `packages.list` file.

You can use the tlmgr command to install the packages as follows:

```bash
$ tlmgr install <package1> <package2> ...
```

## Usage

To generate a CV, you can use the provided shell script, which offers flexibility through various command-line options.

## Default CV Generation

Running the script without any options will generate the CV using the default configuration (`cv.yaml`) located in the `config` directory.

```bash
$ ./run.sh
```

This command will also check and install all necessary dependencies before generating a `.tex` file and a PDF file, both of which will be saved in the `output` directory.

### For Users Without a LaTeX Engine Installed

> Note: If you are using the Docker-based setup, you can ignore this section as the PDF will be generated within the container automatically.

If you donâ€™t have a LaTeX engine installed locally, you can use the `--tex-only` option to generate the files required for an external LaTeX renderer:

```bash
$ ./run.sh --tex-only
```

This will generate the following files in the output directory:

- `output.tex`: The main LaTeX source file.
- `resume.cls`: The LaTeX class file required to compile the CV.

Upload both files to an external LaTeX renderer such as [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) to produce the final PDF.

## Customize the CV Generation

You can customize the CV generation by specifying different configuration files, as well as changing the output file location.

- **Specify a different YAML configuration file:**
  ```bash
  $ ./run.sh -c path/to/custom_config.yaml
  ```
- **Change the output file location:**
  ```bash
  $ ./run.sh -o path/to/output/custom_cv.tex
  ```

These options can be combined together as well to suit your needs.

You can customize the content of your CV by editing the YAML configuration file. By default, this is the `cv.yaml` file located in the `config` directory, but you can specify a different YAML file from any location. This file allows you to define your personal details, education, work experience, skills, and more. You can add or remove sections, modify the fields, and tailor the CV content to your specific needs. The supported section types include `education`, `experience`, `skills`, `bullets`, `talks`, and `publications`. For more information, refer to [YAML Configuration](#yaml-configuration) section.

This tool also supports to automatically list your publications based on BibTeX entries provided in a specified BibTeX file. By default, this is the `publications.bib` file located in the `config` directory, but you can use a different BibTeX file from any location. Refer to [BibTeX Configuration](#bibtex-configuration) section for more details on configuring BibTeX entries.

## Skipping Dependency Checks and Installations

If you already have all dependencies installed and want to skip the automatic checking and installation process, use the `--no-deps` option:

```bash
$ ./run.sh --no-deps
```

This option is useful for speeding up subsequent runs when you know that all dependencies are already satisfied.

# YAML Configuration

The YAML configuration file allows you to customize various aspects of your CV. This section provides detailed instructions on configuring each parameter, including the `heading`, `subheading`, and `sections` fields. Each parameter controls different parts of the CV layout and content.

## Heading

The `heading` parameter sets the main title of the CV.

### 6. Publications

The `publications` section type is designed to list all relevant research articles, papers, patents and academic publications. This section automatically pulls data from a user-specified BibTeX file to render the publications in your CV. For more information on how to configure and link your BibTeX file, refer to the [BibTeX Configuration Section](#bibtex-configuration).

| Key       | Type   | Description                                                                           | Required |

| `title`   | string | Title of the publications section.                                                    | Yes      |
| `bibfile` | string | Path to the BibTeX file.                                                              | Yes      |

Example:

```yaml
sections:
  - type: publications
    title: "Publications"
    bibfile: publications.bib

### 7. New Page

The `newpage` section type is used to force the current page to end and start a new one. This can be useful when you want to ensure that certain sections or content start on a fresh page, particularly in situations where visual organization is important.

| Key    | Type   | Description                                                             | Required |
| ------ | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `type` | string | Must be `newpage`. Forces the current page to end and starts a new one. | Yes      |

Example:

```yaml
sections:
  - type: newpage
```

An example of a complete YAML configuration can be found [here](config/cv.yaml).

## Using Special Characters

When configuring your YAML files, you might want to include special formatting within strings, such as bold text, hyperlinks, line breaks, and horizontal spacing. These special characters and formatting options will be automatically converted into the appropriate LaTeX commands during the rendering process. Here's how to use them:

### Supported Characters

- **Bold Text:**  
  To make text bold, wrap the text with `**` (e.g., `"**Bold Text**"`).

- **Italics:**  
  To italicize text, wrap the text with `*` (e.g., `"*Italic Text*"`).

- **Hyperlinks:**  
  To create a hyperlink, use the Markdown link syntax `[text](url)` (e.g., `"[My Portfolio](https://myportfolio.com)"`).

- **Line Breaks:**  
  To insert a line break, use the newline character `\n` (e.g., `"First Line\nSecond Line"`).

- **Horizontal Spacing:**

  - To add a small space, use two spaces (e.g., `"Text  2 spaces later"`).
  - To add an "em" space, use four spaces or a tab (e.g., `"Text    4 spaces later"` or `"Text\twith a tab"`).

- **Quotes**
  - Always use single quotes for quoted phrases (e.g., 'Data Science Club') to avoid issues with double quotes inside YAML.
  - cv-tools will automatically convert these into proper LaTeX-style double quotes (``like this'') during rendering.

Hereâ€™s an example YAML configuration that utilizes these special characters:

```yaml
heading:
  name: "John Doe" # mandatory

sections:
  - type: education
    content:
      - university: "Fictional University"
        location: "Imaginaria, Wonderland"
        dates: "September 2021 - June 2024"
        degree: "Bachelor of Science in *Computer Science*"
        honors: "**Magna Cum Laude**"
        thesis_title: "An Exploration of ['Quantum Computing'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing) in Virtual Environments"
        supervisor: "Dr. Alice Wonder"
```

# BibTeX Configuration

Managing your publications is straightforward with a BibTeX file. The BibTeX file allows you to maintain a structured list of your publications, which can be automatically formatted and included in your CV.

![publications-section](docs/img/publications-section.png)

## Steps to Configure BibTeX:

1. **Create a BibTeX file:** Create a `.bib` file containing entries for your publications. The tool will automatically format these entries and include them in your CV.
2. **Add a `publications` section:** In your YAML configuration file, add a section with the type `publications`. Use the `title` field to name the section as desired.
3. **Specify the BibTeX file path:** In the `publications` section, set the `bibfile` field to the path of your BibTeX file.

**Example BibTeX Entry:**

> Note that cv-tools will automatically bold the author's name in publications if it matches the heading name.

> In most cases, BibTeX entries do not include the URL field. cv-tools will add the URL link at the end only if the entry contains a URL field. If you would like to include a link to your publication, please add the URL field to the BibTeX entry manually.

```bibtex
@article{doe2024quantum,
  author = {John Doe and Jane Smith and Alice Wonder},
  title = {Quantum Computing: Bridging the Gap Between Theory and Application},
  journal = {Journal of Computer Science},
  year = {2024},
  url = {https://example.com/quantum-computing-paper}
}
```

Your publications will be included in the CV in the order they appear in the .bib file. An example BibTeX data file is provided [here](config/publications.bib).
